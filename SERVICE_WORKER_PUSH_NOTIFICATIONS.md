# Service Worker Push Notifications Implementation

## Overview

This app now supports **true Web Push Notifications** using Service Workers! This means notifications will work even when:
- ‚úÖ Browser is minimized
- ‚úÖ User is on a different tab
- ‚úÖ **Browser is completely closed** (as long as it's running in the background)

## What Changed from Polling?

### Old System (Polling)
- ‚ùå Only worked when app was open
- ‚ùå Required constant server polling (every 3-5 seconds)
- ‚ùå Higher battery and server resource usage
- ‚ùå Stopped working when browser tab closed

### New System (Service Worker + Web Push)
- ‚úÖ Works even when browser is closed
- ‚úÖ No polling needed - server sends notifications directly
- ‚úÖ Better battery life and performance
- ‚úÖ Native OS notifications
- ‚úÖ More reliable and instant

## Architecture

### 1. Service Worker (`public/sw.js`)
- Runs in background, independent of app
- Receives push events from server
- Shows notifications even when app closed
- Handles notification clicks (opens app to correct page)

### 2. Push Subscription System
- **Client side** (`lib/notifications.ts`):
  - Requests notification permission from user
  - Creates push subscription with browser
  - Sends subscription to server
  - Converts VAPID public key for browser

- **Server side** (`lib/push-server.ts`):
  - Stores user push subscriptions in MongoDB
  - Sends push notifications via web-push library
  - Handles expired/invalid subscriptions
  - Includes retry logic and error handling

### 3. Database Model (`models/PushSubscription.ts`)
- Stores push subscription data per user
- Fields: `userId`, `endpoint`, `keys` (p256dh, auth)
- Compound index to prevent duplicates
- Automatically cleaned up when invalid

### 4. API Endpoints

**`/api/push/subscribe`** (POST)
- Saves user's push subscription to database
- Requires authentication
- Updates existing subscription if already exists

**`/api/push/unsubscribe`** (POST)
- Removes all push subscriptions for user
- Called on logout or notification disable

### 5. Notification Triggers

Push notifications are automatically sent when:

**`/api/swipe`** (POST) - Swipe/Like Events
- Someone likes your profile ‚Üí Like notification to you
- Mutual like (match) ‚Üí Match notification to both users

**`/api/messages`** (POST) - New Messages
- Someone sends you a message ‚Üí Message notification with preview

## VAPID Keys Setup

VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys are required for Web Push:

### Generate Keys
```bash
node generate-vapid-keys.js
```

This will output three environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BEj811MbO9nrimQF9qa8ahuyUVNzh-CcW_jPAckTc0-MNuzb7npubmLH1RyNPrqYsRXfjOO96kCMWEv-FXpb7xk
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=k3AFGgYiRqi6LjhK2tjLskiTihWLOXqTHps6Lnlo23g
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:support@nxtdate.com
```

### Local Development
Already added to `.env.local` ‚úÖ

### Production (Vercel)
Add these to your Vercel environment variables:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` (Public key)
   - `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` (Private key - mark as **Sensitive**)
   - `VAPID_SUBJECT` (Your support email)
3. Redeploy after adding variables

## User Flow

### Initial Setup (First Time)
1. User logs in or registers
2. Browser prompts: "Allow notifications?"
3. User clicks "Allow"
4. App subscribes user to push notifications
5. Subscription saved to database

### Receiving Notifications
1. Event occurs (someone likes you, sends message, etc.)
2. Server triggers push notification via `lib/push-server.ts`
3. Push notification sent to browser (even if closed)
4. Service Worker receives push event
5. Service Worker shows notification
6. User clicks notification ‚Üí App opens to relevant page

### Notification Click Behavior
- **Match notification** ‚Üí Opens `/matches` page
- **Like notification** ‚Üí Opens `/matches` page
- **Message notification** ‚Üí Opens `/chat/[matchId]` page

## Testing

### Test Push Notifications

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (Service Workers require HTTPS):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Service Worker push notifications"
   git push
   ```

2. **Open app on deployed site** (https://nxtdate.vercel.app)

3. **Grant notification permission** when prompted

4. **Test scenarios**:
   - Have a friend like your profile
   - Have a friend send you a message
   - Close browser completely
   - Notification should still appear!

### Troubleshooting

**Notifications not appearing?**
1. Check browser console for `[Service Worker]` logs
2. Verify VAPID keys are set in Vercel
3. Check notification permission: Settings ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Notifications
4. Try unregistering service worker and re-registering:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(regs => regs.forEach(reg => reg.unregister()))
   ```

**Service Worker not installing?**
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Application tab ‚Üí Service Workers
2. Check for registration errors
3. Click "Unregister" and refresh page
4. Must be on HTTPS (localhost and Vercel work)

**Push subscription failing?**
1. Check MongoDB connection
2. Verify authentication token is valid
3. Check `/api/push/subscribe` endpoint logs
4. Try logging out and back in

## Browser Support

| Browser | Service Workers | Web Push | Works When Closed? |
|---------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| Chrome  | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| Firefox | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| Edge    | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| Safari  | ‚úÖ Yes (16.4+) | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited*       |
| Mobile  | ‚úÖ Android     | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Varies**       |

*Safari: Notifications work, but browser must be running (not force-quit)
**Mobile: Android supports background push, iOS has limitations

## Files Changed/Added

### New Files
- `public/sw.js` - Service Worker implementation
- `components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` - SW registration component
- `lib/push-server.ts` - Server-side push notification sender
- `models/PushSubscription.ts` - MongoDB model for subscriptions
- `app/api/push/subscribe/route.ts` - Subscription endpoint
- `app/api/push/unsubscribe/route.ts` - Unsubscribe endpoint
- `generate-vapid-keys.js` - VAPID key generator script

### Modified Files
- `lib/notifications.ts` - Added push subscription functions
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added ServiceWorkerRegistration component
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Auto-subscribe on login
- `app/api/swipe/route.ts` - Send push on like/match
- `app/api/messages/route.ts` - Send push on new message
- `.env.local` - Added VAPID keys

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER commit VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY to version control!**

The private key is already in `.env.local` which is in `.gitignore`. 

For production:
- Store in Vercel environment variables (marked as Sensitive)
- Never expose in client-side code
- Only use on server-side (API routes, server components)

## Performance

### Resource Usage
- **Service Worker**: ~2-5 MB memory (runs in background)
- **Push notification**: ~1-2 KB per notification
- **Database**: One subscription document per user per device

### Optimizations
- Subscriptions cleaned up automatically when invalid
- Old/expired subscriptions removed on error
- No polling needed (saves battery and bandwidth)
- Notifications batched if multiple events occur quickly

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Service Worker implemented
2. ‚úÖ Push subscription system created
3. ‚úÖ VAPID keys generated and configured
4. ‚úÖ Integrated into like/match/message events
5. ‚è≥ **Test on deployed site (Vercel)**
6. ‚è≥ Monitor performance and user feedback
7. üîÆ Future: Add notification preferences (mute, customize)

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify VAPID keys in Vercel
3. Test on latest Chrome/Firefox first
4. Ensure HTTPS is enabled
5. Check MongoDB for subscription documents

**Congratulations!** üéâ Your app now has production-grade push notifications that work even when the browser is closed!
